The simple nature of git makes it very complicated 
    Git has its own logic
    one working file - logged prior files
Forces all group members to follow one system -safe, standard 
    manages small and large changes 
    automates busywork
We need the understanding of State
    one change = three versions 
    most computer systems abstract this 
I've already donee the set-up
    bash is a command shell 
        a lot like finder
    commit or it didn't happen 
    renaming = new file in th logic of git
