File management systems used to work very similar to libraries
    you would have to check out files before working on them
pwd - print working directory
cd - change directory
mkdir - make directory
rmdir - remove directory
mv - move (utilize to rename files)
git init - creates synched git repository
git rm - tells git that the file was removed
git add - tells git that file was changed/added 
git status - checks if files are ready for commit
git commit -- message   - commits to the repository with message
git clone url- tells git to clone specific url 
git remote -v - checks what remotes are installed on working directory
git fetch [remote-name] - fetches info from remote
git -am “message” - adds, commits with message given



git pull url - tells git to give you updated git repository
git push origin master - sends current commits to github
ls ~/.ssh - checks your ssh keys
ssh-keygen - generates key pair for ssh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" - runs ssh agent
git remote rm origin - removes old origin
git remote add origin urlfromgit - removes old origin

git remote -v - gives you info for your remotes
