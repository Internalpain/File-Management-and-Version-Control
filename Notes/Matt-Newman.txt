File management systems used to work very similar to libraries
    you would have to check out files before working on them
pwd - print working directory
cd - change directory
mkdir - make directory
rmdir - remove directory
mv - move (utilize to rename files)
git init - creates synched git repository
git rm - tells git that the file was removed
git add - tells git that file was changed/added 
git status - checks if files are ready for commit
git commit -- message   - commits to the repository with message
git clone url- tells git to clone specific url 
git remote -v - checks what remotes are installed on working directory
git fetch [remote-name] - fetches info from remote

Dear diary,
I am a man of diginity, and this git has really been pulling down my trousers.
