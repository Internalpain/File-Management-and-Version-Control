## Course Description

This class covers the fundamentals of file management and version control. While these are often focused on programming, this class is designed for programmers, artists, and designers alike. Everyone who plans to work professionally on projects that involve programming, asset (visual and otherwise) creation, milestones, and deadlines should expect to use some form of version control software. Having previous experience with git is something that many employers look for.

We will cover how to use the distributed version control system known as git, online repositories like Github and BitBucket, graphical user interfaces for git like Github Desktop and SourceTree, and software focused on visual assets like Folio and Kaleidoscope. The goal of the class is to demystify Github, git, and version control in general. All course materials will be stored on either GitHub or BitBucket, students will be expected to turn in their work via one of these services. We’re going to dive right in and build a class repository together.

## Course Materials

1. Our course textbook is [Git for Humans](http://abookapart.com/products/git-for-humans) by David Demaree. 
2. Access to your own laptop, on which you can install git and the other software we'll be using. If you don't have access to your own computer for this class, the professor will work with you to arrange a solution.

## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will have significant experience with the following. These are thus the goals for the course, and students will have enough practice to consider these as *design practices* by the end of the course.

1. Understand some of the history of file management and version control.
1. Explain the need for a distributed version control system.
1. Comfortably use the command line for git and other tasks.
1. Demonstrate familiarity with the most common git commands and workflows for modifying commands on a isolated repository.
1. Demonstrate familiarity with git commands used for working on a remote repository.
1. Regularly contribute to a github repository via cloning, branching, and pull requests.
1. Regularly contribute to a github project via the wiki and issue tracker.
1. Identify, assess, and utilize online resources for further learning.

## Course Policies

### What I Expect of You

* Contribute to the class Github Issue tracker as you have questions.
* Contribute to the class Github wiki as you find useful git resources or have new knowledge to contribute.
* Keep regular notes on this class in a text file or series of text files.
* Attend each class. 

### What You Can Expect From Me

* Prompt responses to issues posted in the Github issue tracker.
* Responses to emails, texts, and phone messages/calls within 48 hours (24 if the message is urgent).

### Attendance Policy

### Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy

Any student who has a documented disability and is in need of academic accommodations should notify the professor of this course and contact the Office of Differing Abilities Services (609-771-2571). Accommodations are individualized and in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1992.

## Assignments and Grading

Because this is a mini-course, it does not have a traditional grading component. That doesn't mean that you won't get feedback on your assignments; just that this class will run much more like a workshop than it will like a class. I'll assume that you're here because you have an interest in learning about version control and, specifically, about git and Github. The assignments reflect this. If you complete the assignments and participate, you'll pass. If not, you won't.

### Grades

To achieve a passing grade in this mini-course, students will be required to complete each reading and participate (the specific activities will be assigned at each class meeting) on the class repository on Github.com.
